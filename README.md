1. Overview
This application provides an interactive MATLAB App Designer-based interface for simulating and visualizing the structure of a photovoltaic (PV) module. Users can configure the physical characteristics of the module, simulate solar irradiance effects, compute power output, and view the geometry in multiple perspectives. The app supports both educational and design-oriented use cases.

2. Objectives
•	Enable users to define a solar module with customizable dimensions and materials.
•	Provide a realistic 3D visualization of the solar panel including structural layers.
•	Allow irradiance-based color mapping of individual cells.
•	Support power calculation based on real-time irradiance and cell parameters.
•	Offer functionality to save and load complete module configurations.
•	Improve interaction with the model via different camera views and component toggles.

3. Key Features
3.1. Geometry Configuration
The app allows detailed input of physical dimensions and materials, including:
•	Module width and height
•	Front and rear glass thickness
•	Front and rear encapsulant thickness
•	Number of cell rows and columns
•	Cell spacing
•	Frame thickness
•	Cell dimensions (selectable from standard dropdown list)
3.2. 3D Layered Visualization
The solar panel is rendered as a layered structure using patch() and rectangle() objects. Layers include:
•	Rear glass
•	Rear encapsulant
•	Photovoltaic cells
•	Front encapsulant
•	Front glass
3.3. Frame Rendering
An E-shaped aluminum frame is drawn at multiple vertical layers to simulate structural framing. A checkbox allows users to toggle the visibility of the frame.
3.4. Camera Views
Users can select from multiple viewing angles using a dropdown menu:
•	Top
•	Bottom
•	Side
•	Front
•	Isometric
The app adjusts the camera position and projection method (e.g., orthographic) accordingly to ensure consistent visual representation.
3.5. Irradiance and Cell Coloring
Users can enter a manual irradiance value (in W/m²). The color of the solar cells changes dynamically based on the irradiance:
•	Low irradiance produces cooler colors (blue)
•	High irradiance produces warmer colors (red)
The app uses a continuous color gradient and displays a corresponding legend.
3.6. Power Output Calculation
The electrical power output is computed using:
P=GHI× Active Area ×η 
Where:
•	GHI the irradiance in W/m² (user-defined)
•	Active Area  is the total active cell area
•	η is the module efficiency 
The computed value is displayed graphically in the plot or via annotation.
3.87 Save and Load Configuration
The current module configuration can be saved to a .mat file and reloaded later. Saved parameters include:
•	Geometry
•	Cell layout
•	Material thicknesses
•	Irradiance and efficiency
•	Frame visibility
•	View orientation
