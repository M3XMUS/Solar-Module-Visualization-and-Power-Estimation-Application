# Solar Module Visualization and Power Estimation App

This MATLAB App provides an interactive 3D visualization of a photovoltaic (PV) solar module. Built using **App Designer**, it allows users to define module geometry, simulate irradiance effects, compute power output, and render all physical components with realistic proportions.

## Features

- 📐 **Fully Configurable Geometry**  
  Input dimensions for module width, height, glass/encapsulant thicknesses, frame, cell size, and layout (rows × columns).

- 🧱 **Layered 3D Visualization**  
  Renders glass layers, encapsulant layers, photovoltaic cells, E-shaped aluminum frame, and junction box using `patch` graphics.

- 🎥 **Multiple Camera Views**  
  Choose from Top, Bottom, Front, Side, and Isometric views via dropdown.

- 🔆 **Irradiance-Based Cell Coloring**  
  Cells change color based on user-defined irradiance (W/m²), visualizing solar energy input using a red-to-blue gradient.

- ⚡ **Power Estimation**  
  Calculates estimated power output based on active cell area and efficiency:
Power = GHI × CellArea × Efficiency
